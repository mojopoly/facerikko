Project Guidelines
The aim for this project is to build a facial image recognition web app using the latest technology trends. To complete the project, the below user stories needed to be fulfilled:

I can paste the url of an image, click on a button and have the faces (if any are found) detected with a square box with some demographics about the face including age, gender, and ethnicity.
I am able to register
I am able to login and logout
There is an image upload counter that tells each user the total number of image uploads that they have done
The page UI is different when the user is logged in

Project Approach
For this full-stack web application, I created the front end components and UI using React, JavaScript, CSS & HTML. This involved creating the signin, register and the home (logged in) screens.

The next part was creating the backend of this project using node.js and express and ensuring that the GET, POST and PUT requests would properly function handling the API calls to Clarifai, as well as handling the data. Later on, the data would be connected to a database.

The last part of the web app was to build a relational database using PostgreSQL to retrieve, store and update each user's data. All these aspects were connected together and tested to ensure each part works.

The app was fully deployed to Heroku.
